      <p>
        I’m Emmanuel Eshun from Accra, Ghana. As a Web Development and Design student at BYU-Idaho, I aim to build digital experiences that reflect excellence, integrity, and Christ-centered service.
        I serve as Secretary of the AAA Children’s Ministry and create faith-based content on TikTok (“Journey with EL”) and LinkedIn to share hope and truth through technology.

      <h2>Ghana & My Mission</h2>

      <p>
        Ghana—known as the “Gateway to Africa”—is rich in culture, faith, and innovation. While Ghana is famed for its biodiversity, my homeland inspires me to serve with purpose.
        Guided by Ephesians 6:7–8, I pursue development not just as a career, but as worship: “Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord.” My mission is to build tools that advance education, evangelism, and eternal impact.
